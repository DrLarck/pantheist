### What is pantheist ?
**Pantheist** is a free and open-source moderation Discord Bot.
It has been first developped for the **Discord Ball Z** community.
The project has started on **23/04/2019** at 10 PM (GMT +1) in France.

### How does it work ?
**Pantheist** is written in **python3.7** which means that if you want to run it by yourself, you need to download the right **python** version.
For the moment the bot isn't well developped, but it will be designed to let anyone run it on their machine and let them free to modify the code as they want.

To run it, type one of these commands in your terminal :
* Windows :
`python -B main.py`

* Ubuntu :
`python3.7 -B main.py`

*(The `-B` parameter avoid the creation of the `__pycache__` folders and files)*

### Requirements
The requirements are the followings : 
* `python version 3.7` or higher.
* `asyncpg`
    * `asyncpg` is required for the **database**. We're using **PostgreSQL**.
